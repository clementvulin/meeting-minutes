= Meeting @ ETH – Dec 14, 2015

Martin, Clément, Daan, Simon, Dominique, Rahel

== Intro / Agenda

Two areas of collaboration:

* **Joint research:** Biological data & visualization tools -> hypothesis generation
* **Custom development:** Address immediate pain points
** Orchestrate analysis workflow
** Make manual steps less cumbersome
** Improve automatic segmentation

== Status Quo

=== Existing pipeline

Microscope -> ImageJ / MATLAB -> TIFF -> Movies -> ZIP -> Dropbox

* 1 experiment / week (40 positions; ~ 5 GB each)
* Limited by throughput

=== Manual Analysis Workflow

Dropbox -> Tracking / Segmentation -> Correction -> Scripts (e.g. cell size calculation)

* Send to students
* Manual "load balancing"
* Manual "result tracking"

=== Cumbersome architecture

* MATLAB on client machines (manual maintenance)
* Errors on client (students cannot proceed until fixed, manual patching of scripts)
* MATLAB also used for manual segmentation -> probably not the ideal tool

== Possible Solutions

* Use http://activiti.org[Activiti] for workflow orchestration
* Replace MATLAB segmentation on client
* Keep MATLAB scripts on server (but trigger via Activiti)

== Non-Functional Requirements

* Web UI vs Fat Client?
* Security not important (but users identifiable)
* Not ETH-specific -> OSS a valid option
* Maintainable (future PhDs and Post-Docs might not be as computer-savvy)

== Next Steps

* Legal agreement (FHNW)
* High-level architecture (FHNW)
* Analysis workflow prototype (FHNW)
* Bring Alex into project for image analysis expertise (FHNW)

== Next Meeting

* Smaller group, roughly Q1/2016
